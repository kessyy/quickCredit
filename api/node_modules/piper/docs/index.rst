Amazing Event Handling and Routing
==================================

Yes, it's a big claim, but we think Piper makes some pretty cool stuff possible.  Using the wonderful event library `eve`__, Piper allows you to create **vapor-coupled** applications.

You see, eve turns event binding and handling pretty much on it's head, so that it feels much more like working with a pubsub system.  Piper takes the core functionality and adds some extra goodness such as namespacing, chaining and bridging via various systems.
